I am currently enjoying Machine Learning. I with a team developed [Mood Indigo 2019](http://moodi.org) app and website. My major interest is in field of Data Analytics but can work on devlopment too for living.

I am always surrounded by positivity and happiness. I frequently crack good and poor jokes depending upon how quickly I framed it.
